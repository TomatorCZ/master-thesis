\chapter{Attachments}

Table \ref{img80:attachment} describes content of the attachment.
Although the attachment contains most of the thesis outcomes, part of the outcome is placed on public GitHub repository where futher discussions regarding the change, made by C\# community members and \ac{LDT}, continues.

\section{Build and run Demo}

Thesis contains demo which can be used as a playground for testing the change.
.NET SDK is needed to be able to compile and run demo.
We used version 8.0.100 which can be downloaded from Microsoft offical websites.
\par
After the download, make sure that you don't have \texttt{Microsoft.Net.Compilers.Toolset.4.9.0-dev} package in your nuget packages cache.
The cache is usually placed in \texttt{C:\\Users\\\%user\%\\.nuget} folder.
Then, navigate to the \texttt{Demo} folder and run \texttt{dotnet build} which builds demo example.

\section{Build your applications}

You can try to build already existing C\# projects by modified compiler by adding following code fragment to \texttt{.csproj} file.
\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{lstlisting}
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <RestoreSources>
      path/to/Attachment/Bin/folder
    </RestoreSources>
  </PropertyGroup>

  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference 
      Include="Microsoft.Net.Compilers.Toolset" 
      Version="4.9.0-dev"/>
  </ItemGroup>
</Project>
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{\texttt{.csproj} project}
\label{img81:usage}
\end{figure}
Then, you can again use common \texttt{dotnet build} to build your application.
