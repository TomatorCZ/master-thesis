\chapter{Future work} \label{sect14:future}

Since \ac{LDM} agreed to proceed with the partial type inference, the following work addresses future comments in the PR \cite{online:pull2}. 
Simultaneously, there is the discussion \cite{online:mettingSummaryDisc} regarding the meeting where the feature is discussed. 
So, the continuation of this work is replying to potential questions there.
\par
Besides that, there is a plan to have the next two \ac{LDM} meetings regarding further proceeding with the proposal, which will be cut into smaller pieces to let the LDM discuss it properly. 
The first meeting will regard top-level inferred type arguments in object creation expression. 
The second meeting will regard nested inferred type arguments in object creation expression.
\par
After the meetings, we expect that the proposal will be ready for ready-to-production implementation. 
It is likely that during the process of continuing discussions, the proposal will be divided into more pieces, which will be delivered across multiple releases.
