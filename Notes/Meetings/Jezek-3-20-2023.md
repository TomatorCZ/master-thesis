# Before meeting

Not sure if it is a sufficient work for master thesis.
There are two parts. Firstly, I need to write proposals. Then, I have to make an implementation containing tests.
Implementation probably will not contain a lot of lines of code.
All issues are mentioned on GitHub.
Some of them have some possible solutions.
My work would be to combine them, write proposals, think of possible breaking changes, make implementation with changes.
Should we think some draft ?? 

# Meeting

It is ok, I should continue...
