# Explicit partial type inference

## Summary

Allow a user to specify only necessary type arguments of

1. Generic method or local function call
2. Generic object and delegate creation
3. Variable declaration of a generic type
4. Cast

by introducing the `_` placeholder to mark type arguments inferred by the compiler.

## Motivation

The current method type inference works as an "all or nothing" principle. 
If the compiler is not able to infer command call type arguments, the user has to specify all of them.
This requirement can be verbose, noisy, and unnecessary in cases where the compiler is able to infer almost all type arguments and need just to specify ambiguous ones.
In these cases, we would like to give the compiler a hint for ambiguous type arguments.
The current source of dependencies, which are used in type inference is restricted to method/function arguments which prevent making the whole type argument list inference in even simple scenarios.
We could use the `_` placeholder for type arguments, which can be inferred from the argument list, and specify the remaining type arguments by ourselves.
The potential additional sources of type information are specified below.

- **Inference by target type** - The current method type inference doesn't use target type for determining type argument in inference resulting in specifying the whole argument list.
- **Inference by `where` clauses** - Utilizing `where` clauses to determine the type argument.
- **Inference by later calls** - Utilizing later method calls to determine the type of the generic object (useful for object creation).
- **Inference by inheritance or implementation** - Utilizing implemented interfaces or inherited class for determining type argument.

Because of restricted type inference, `_` can be used only in restricted scenarios.
However, the potential of this feature with a combination of mentioned type inference improvements can bring more useful cases where to place `_`.
See the following examples, where `_` can be used to hint the compiler type arguments, which could be inferred in case of implemented mentioned inference improvements.

```csharp
TResult Foo<TParam, TResult>(TParam p)
where TResult ...
{ ... }

MyResult res = Foo<_, MyResult>(myVar); // We can hint the compiler the target type
```

```csharp
void Foo<TList, TElem>(TList p) 
where TList : List<TElem>
{}

Foo<_, int>(new List<int>()) // We can hint the compiler info from `where` clauses
```

```csharp
class Foo<T1, T2> {
    Foo(T1 p) {}
    public void Bar(T2 p) {}
}

var a = Foo<_, int>("str"); // We can hint the compiler type arguments obtained from later calls
a.Bar(1);
```

```csharp
class Foo<TElem, TParam> : IEnumerable<TElem> {
    Foo(TParam p) {}
}

IEnumerable<int> = new Foo<int, _>(42); // we can hint the compiler type argument obtained from interface implementation or class inheritance
```

Even if all of these sources would be used during method inference, there will be still type arguments, which can't be inferred from the context.
We are talking about type arguments, which are used internally in the class or struct and are not exposed to global API.
So It would be still beneficial to have the `_` placeholder.

As you could see in the example, we see a potential to use type inference in constructors.
The motivation behind this can be to specify just the wrapper implementation and let the elements inside the wrapper be inferred.
It would help to make documentation right by the code with the meaning "This segment of code primarily cares about the wrapper".

```csharp
var a = new Wrapper<_>(wrappedElement)
```

Another need where `_` placeholders can be used is specifying the arity of type argument on places, where can be ambiguities like `IEnumerable` vs `IEnumerable<_>`.

Worth to mention other options which could be accomplished in the future regarding default and named type arguments.
Having the `_` placeholder can be used as a shortcut for choosing the right generic overload and to save typing when we use named type parameters.

```csharp
class Foo<T1, T2 = int> {}
class Foo<T1, T2 = int, T3 = string> {}

new Foo<T1: _, T2: string, T3 = _>() // Assuming that T1 can be inferred and T3 is default.
new Foo<_,_> // Choosing Foo<T1, T2> based on the arity
```

Method type inference(including object creation) is not the only place where we can use the `_` placeholder.
Sometimes `var` keyword as a variable declaration is not sufficient. 
We would like to be able to specify more the type information about variable but still have some implementation details hidden.
With the `_` placeholder we would be able to specify more the shape of the variable avoiding unnecessary specification of type arguments. 

```csharp
Wrapper<_> wrapper = ... // I get an wrapper, which I'm interested in, but I don't care about the type arguments, because I don't need them in my code.
wrapper.DoSomething();
```
At the end, casting could use the `_` placeholder as well.

```csharp
Foo<int, string> myvar = (Foo<_,_>)myobject; // Hint the type arguments based on target or other potential source of type information like default or named type arguments.
```

An interesting thing would be to allow the `_` placeholder in member lookup as you can see in the example below.
On the first see, it can look wierd.

```csharp
static class C1<T1> {
    static class C2 <T2> {
        public (T1, T2) Foo(T1 t, T2 t) {}
    }
}

var a = C1<_>.C2<_>.Foo(1, 1);
```

But in combination with default parameters, It might be useful in cases, where we use entity as a global provider of something, which we determine by type.

```csharp
static class Factory<T = Default> {
    public static T Create(){...}
}

int a = Factory<_>.Create(); // Calls Factory<int>.Create();
var b = Factory<_>.Create(); // Calls Factory<Default>.Create();
```

Although it is unlikely that it would be added into C#, we would like to investigate what should be done to enable it for a deeper understanding of type inference in Roslyn.

Based on mentioned advantages that `_` placeholder can bring to type inference we feel to add it to C# worthly.

## Scope

Partial type inference can be solved in various ways.
We chose a feature enabling to hint the compiler by specifying ambitious type arguments and letting the remaining ones on him.
It aims at cases, where we want just to specify the arity of desired generic method(type) or specify a parameter that is not possible to infer from the context but let the compiler infer the remaining arguments. 

## Design

As we mentioned in the motivation, we see the usage of our proposal in the following places.

1. method call
2. object construction
3. variable declaration
4. casting

### Method call

We would like to somehow mark inferred type arguments. 
The most natural approach would be to replace the type arguments with some keyword. 
Let's pick `_` for it for now and show it in the examples.

```csharp
void foo<T1, T2, T3>(T2 arg) {}

foo<int, _, int>("string"); // _ is marked as "inferred by compiler"
```

One can suggest not marking it and just leaving it on the compiler. 
However, it would bring ambiguities between which arguments should be inferred. 

```csharp
void foo(int arg1, int arg2) {}
void foo<T1>(T1 arg1, int arg2) {}
void foo<T1, T2>(T1 arg1, T2 arg2) {}

foo(1,2); // We don't know which overload to choose
foo<>(1,2); // Still, it is not clear which generic overload should be choose.
```

Because of mentioned issues, we believe that marking each type argument, what the compiler will infer, is the right way how to do it.
To make it possible, we would have to change C# grammar

```
invocation_expression
    : primary_expression '(' argument_list? ')'
    : simple_name_u '(' argument_list? ')'
    : member_access_u '(' argument_list? ')'
    : null_conditional_member_access_u '(' argument_list? ')'
    ;

simple_name_u
    : identifier type_argument_list_u?
    ;

member_access_u
    : primary_expression '.' identifier type_argument_list_u?
    | predefined_type '.' identifier type_argument_list_u?
    | qualified_alias_member '.' identifier type_argument_list_u?
    ;

null_conditional_member_access_u
    : primary_expression '?' '.' identifier type_argument_list?
      dependent_access* dependent_member_access_u?
    | primary_expression '?' '.' identifier type_argument_list_u?
    ;
    
dependent_access
    : '.' identifier type_argument_list?    // member access
    | '[' argument_list ']'                 // element access
    | '(' argument_list? ')'                // invocation
    ;

dependent_member_access_u
    : '.' identifier type_argument_list_u?    // member access
    ;

type_argument_list_u
    : '<' type_arguments_u '>'
    ;

type_arguments_u
    : type_argument_u (',' type_argument_u)*
    ;   

type_argument_u
    : type | '_'
    ;

```

To be able to use it in invocation, we have to modify the method invocation and type inference algorithm.

If we consider dynamic overload resolution, we modify compile-time checks to reflect the change.

There raises the question if we can go further and allow `_` to be nested 
See the following example.

```csharp
TResult GetResult<TResult>() where TResult : IEnumerable<string> {}

var results = GetResult<List<_>>(); // Just specifying wrapper implementation.
```

It would be most beneficial during working with any generic wrappers, where we are curious about the wrapper implementation, but not which will be inside the wrapper.

This kind of wildcard needs more information about the relation between type arguments to become useful.
More information can be extracted from generic type constraints, which can bring also more inference power to simple `_` inferred types.
Unfortunately, using information about constraints in type inference causes breaking change, see the following example.

```csharp
void M(object) {}
void M<T, U>(T t) where T : IEnumerable<U> {}

M("foo");
```

One option would be to somehow differ between old inference and new improved inference like that.

```csharp
void M(object) {} // 1.
void M<T, U>(U t) where T : IEnumerable<U> {} // 2.

M<_, _>("foo"); // calls 2.
M("foo"); // calls 1.
```

Because of this breaking change, we can use the constraints only with `_` inferred types, which is not presented in the current language version so it doesn't cause a breaking change.

One can feel that `M<_,_>(...)` should be resolved in the same manner as `M(...)`. 
This is a reasonable argument and we feel that it should follow it.
For this reason, we would postpone this extended feature to future improvements where we would be able to use the constraints without causing a breaking change.
This could be done by some tool that patches the old code.

## Alternatives

We can choose different char or keywords for determining compiler inferred type argument. Other options consist of `*`, `var`, `?`, `<<whitespace>>`. Although, we think that `_` fits better because the same char is used in deconstruction assignments or patterns.
