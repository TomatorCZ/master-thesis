The introduction \ref{sect:summary} sets four goals, which are gradually achieved by the thesis. 
It starts by exploring C\# type inference by using the language specification and implementation in the Roslyn project. 
Then, it compares with Rust type inference, which offers more advanced type inference than C\#. 
These differences are explained using the theory background of Hindley-Milner type inference, which describes the limits of type inference in strongly typed languages.
\par
Based on these observations, the work selects a subset of type inference improvements suggested in C\# language discussions on GitHub and explores the motivation behind it to make it likely to add to C\# language. 
The motivation is described in the created proposal, which is the fourth goal and which describes the improvement in terms of changing the specification.
\par
Together with the proposal, the implementation was made in the Roslyn project fork, with unit tests checking the functionality. 
This was the last goal of the proposal. 
The implementation ensured that basic compiler tests passed to reveal possible issues with the solution.
\par
In addition to the mentioned goals, the thesis succeeded in presenting the proposal and implementation to the \ac{LDM} responsible for approving language changes into C\#. 
The committee agreed to continue with the change for further discussion and is generally inclined to ship it with future language releases.
\par
Based on the goals achieved and additional success in the \ac{LDM} meeting, which was not a part of the scope of the work, we think that the thesis accomplished all the promised goals.
