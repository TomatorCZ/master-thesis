The introduction \ref{sect:summary} setted four goals which are gradualy achieved by the thesis.
It started by exploring C\# type inference by using the language specification and implementation in the Roslyn project.
Then, It was comapred with Rust type inference which offers more advanced type inference in comparison to C\#.
These differencies were explained using theory background of Hindley-Milner type inference which bounded posibilities of type inference in strongly type languages.
\par
Based on these observations, the work selected a subset of type inference improvements suggested in C\# langauge discussions on GitHub and explored the motivation behind it to make it likely to add into C\# language.
The motivation was described in the created proposal which is the forth goal and which described the improvement in terms of changing the specification.
\par
Together with the proposal, the implementation was made in the Roslyn project fork, with unit tests checking the functionality.
This was the last goal of the proposal.
The implementation ensured that basic compiler tests passed to reveal possible issues with the solution.
\par
Additional to the mentioned goals, the thesis suceeded in presenting the proposal and implementation to \ac{LDM} responsible for approving language changes into C\#.
The presentation was a success in the meaning that the committe agreed on continue with the change for futher discussion and generally is inclined to ship it with future language releases.
\par
Based on the achieved goals and additional success in \ac{LDM} meeting which was not in the scope of the work, we think that the thesis accomplished all promised goals.
