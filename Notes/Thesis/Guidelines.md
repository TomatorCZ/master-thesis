# Guidelines

C# is a strongly and statically typed, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft. 
Since types have to be known in compilation time, a type inference was introduced to reduce typing of obvious type annotations. 
However, type inference in C# is not as strong as we can see in other strongly statically typed languages like RUST or Haskell.
Since Roslyn is an open-source compiler of C#, an open community has joined the development of the language and the compiler. // vypustit

// The goal of this thesis is to investigate...
This thesis aims to investigate the boundaries of C# type inference and compare it with existing implementations in different languages. 
// Zmenit cas, co se bude delat.. -> should propose....
Then proposes improvements regarding the type inference based on the previous analysis and creates a prototype. 
// Author bude spolupracovat ....
During the work, we will closely work with Roslyn team to make the proposal more likely to be accepted by the commitee for C# standard and the Roslyn team.
