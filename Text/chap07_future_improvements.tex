\chapter{Future Work} \label{sect14:future}

Since LDM agreed to proceed with the partial type inference, the following work addresses future comments in the PR \cite{online:pull2}. 
Simultaneously, there is the discussion \cite{online:mettingSummaryDisc} regarding the meeting where the feature is discussed. 
So, the continuation of this thesis is replying to potential questions there.
\par
Besides that, there is a plan to have the next LDM meeting regarding further proceeding with the proposal, which will be cut into smaller pieces to let the LDM discuss it properly. 
The meeting will regard two items.
The first item is top-level inferred type arguments in the method invocation and object creation expression. 
The second item is nested inferred type arguments in the method invocation and object creation expression.
\par
It is likely that during the process of continuing discussions, the proposal will be divided into more pieces, which will be delivered across multiple releases.
